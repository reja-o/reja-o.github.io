### Abstract 
<div style="text-align: justify">The objective of the investigation is to link a list of comorbidities of COVID-19 showed on recent studies that make a person more prone to complications if infected. Using geospatial data to predict and identify which geographic zones have more infections, where are happening and make a prediction of future outbreaks and mortality rates.
We took the results of a recent investigation with a sample of 177, 133 subjects on May 18th, 220 where it was observed 1, 633 with SARS-CoV-2, and 5,332 deaths to make our calculations. The principal risk factors for lethality in COVID-19 include diabetes, obesity, advanced age and immunosuppression. Those factors conferred an increased risk of hospitalization and possible intubation.

### Introduction         
**What did we do?**
 <div style="text-align: justify"> We made a big search of recent studies that investigated the principal risk factors that could lead to a complicated situation for the infected people and compare each one to identify which ones could have a bigger impact in México for its conditions and the geographic zones that are more endangered by its type of population.
After we collected the data, organized and selected it, we started to write the code that would help us to identify the endangered zones and where the last deaths and infections were.</div>
